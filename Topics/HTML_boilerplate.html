<h1>HTML Boilerplate</h1>
<p>HTML boilderplate is what allows us to understand the structure of the html files.
    The boilder plate is a little like a burger, there is an html opening and closing with everything sandwiched inside - 
    (This is the two buns of the burger)
    <br>
    Next, is the head element opening and closing tags this is everything that isnt gonna be shown to the user. 
    But it is all still very important like the meta tag, title; which gets displated in the tab of the web page. 
    (This is like all the sauce and veg)
    <br>
    Finally, is the body element the opening and the closing tags this is all the content, like headings, images videos and so on! 
    This is what the viewers/audiance will see.
    (This is like the meat of the burger!)
