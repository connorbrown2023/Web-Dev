<h1>File Paths</h1>
<p>This topics goes over different file paths and will use images within the folder show about different file paths</p>

<p>There are two types of file paths absolute and relative </p>
<ul>
    <li><h5>Absolute:</h5></li>
    <p>This is the full file path to a spesific location, all the way from the C: drive</p>
    <li><h5>Relative:</h5></li>
    <p>This is file path is relative to the folder that the image is in, 
    so looking at the paths notice how it shows specifces what folder it is in before using the name of the image, it doesnt need the full file path </p>
</ul>

<p>In this topic i have used both the absolute and relative file paths</p>
