<h1>Image Elements</h1>
<p>This page is off show of image elements and only uses place holder photos</p>

<br>

<p>Simiulaly to the anchor tag the main component is an attribute which defines the source of the image, e.g. the image address
    the keyword/letters are src and same again followed by an equals and then the value/image address incased in brackets. 
    The image element, doesnt have a closing tag instead it has a self closing tag known as a void element.
    like the horizontal rule element (hr) and the break element (br). 
    Below is an example of an image element, which will produce a random image.
</p>

<img src="https://picsum.photos/150"/>

<p>Another very important part off the image element is the alt text, 
    which stands for alternative text description and this is for the screen reader.
    Also notice how the image address is different as it has been pulled from a different place, this image below has been pulled the device </p>
