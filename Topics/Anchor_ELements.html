<h1>Anchor Elements</h1>
<p>This is to show off anchor elements</p>

<p>The keyword/attribute is href to use for a URL and it goes inside the the first bracket thingy "< a " attribute (href) "=" "URL" ">"
    the next goes the word that the user is trying to hyper link.
</p>

<a href="https://www.google.com/">This goes to google</a>

<p>However there is all sort of attribute the user can user for example is draggable, the format is the same however as 'draggable' is a boolan, 
    instead of assigning a URL like in href we would assign a true or false value to the attribute </p>

    <a draggable=true>draggable</a>
